# Setup
Move the files other than the python file to 'C:\Documents\maya\2018\prefs\icons\'

# How to use
Create a new scene in maya and run the program.
From there it is straight forward. 
Select the object file you would like to import.
Select an optional texture that comes along with it.
In case it is a rigged character, make sure the checkbox is marked.
Once everything needed has been put in, the button to start the process will become clickable.

After the studio has been created, multiple options become available.
You can open the arnold renderer to see your result.

There are additional studio settings to finetune your render result like brightness, prop positioning, camera positioning, prop turntable animation and more.
